## **_Introduction_**

---

In the evolving landscape of education, students require tools that not only assist in academic learning but also promote social interaction and personal development.
This document outlines the design and development of the Student Hub application, a comprehensive single-page application crafted to enhance the educational and social experience of students. The application aims to facilitate better communication, collaboration, and learning among students, incorporating features such as posts, chat, quizzes, and games. Building upon the principles of the Design Thinking approach, the application is tailored to meet the diverse needs of students, fostering an interactive and engaging learning environment.
The Student Hub application is designed to address these needs by offering a unified platform for communication, learning, and entertainment. This report focuses on the latter stages of the Design Thinking methodology, particularly the Prototype and Test phases.

<br><br>

## **_Methodology:_**

---

The project refers to the Design Thinking methodology throughout the entire project. However, this documentation concentrates on the final two phases, Prototyping and Testing.
The implementation of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) helped simplify the process of monitoring and managing application. Various models are used to arrange the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) in a manner that maximises the efficiency of the development process.

The Agile SDLC methodology, along with the Scrum framework, was applied in the development process of the budget control application. This technique was used, to provide a flexible and continual workflow customised for specific needs and user requirements consisting of Sprints (Iterations). I was able to prioritise features, collect feedback from students, and provide them with additional benefits through this process.

The selection of Scrum for this project corresponds to its unique feature of focusing on one activity at a time, with progression to the next step upon completion of each sprint. The Scrum framework differs from the Agile, which involves regular review and updating of the application. The strategy I implemented involved breaking down the application into smaller components and concentrating on a maximum of one or two functionalities during each sprint.

</p> <br>
 
 
 In the position of an individual working on the development of a budget control application utilising Scrum, I undertook the role of the Product Owner, with the responsibility of defining and prioritising the requirements, as well as the Development Team and Scrum Master, with the task of implementing the features.

The initial step involved the development of User Stories ( [Appendix A](#appendix-a) ), which are brief depictions of essential features and functionalities from the user's viewpoint. The user stories have been written from the point of view of the final consumer, and they have been prioritised in a backlog according to their importance and value.

The project has been broken down into four sprints, each lasting two weeks based on the user stories. Each iteration involved the implementation of distinct features, which were determined based on the user needs established in the previous stages of the Design Thinking methodology. Each iteration has been systematically organised, with a corresponding backlog (see [Appendix B ](#appendix-b)) that contains User Stories, Sprint Goals, and interrelated tasks.

By the end of all iterations, the aim was to have a functional budget control application with the core features outlined in the user stories and tested by the users who resent the target audience and user base of the application. At the end of each sprint, users have been allowed to test the features and fill out a brief survey, in which they have been asked a series of questions about the functionality and UI design of the application. Additionally, they can offer feedback and suggestions for enhancement.

<br><br>

## **Methods:**

---

To achieve an accurate and organised development process for the budget control application, the final two stages of the Design Thinking framework, particularly prototyping and testing, were integrated. Additionally, I choose to discuss the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) model used throughout the application's development stage.

### **Prototype phase :**

---

During the prototyping phase, I adapted the Design Thinking process, which is typically team-oriented, to align with the scope and demands of a small-scale individual project. During the prototype stage, I designed and developed an actual representation of the application's features and user interface. The Figma tool assisted in the visual representation of the proposed functionalities, mockups, and understanding of how the application will look and function.

In compliance with the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) model, as an independent developer, I implemented the Agile methodology utilising the Scrum framework for the development process of the application and obtained multiple roles, including a product owner and user. The above method allowed me to confirm that the prototype complied with the user requirements determined in the initial stages of the Design Thinking methodology. Agile techniques encourage iterative development, teamwork, and flexibility, which makes them appropriate for small-scale, individual projects. The application of the Scrum framework, a commonly implemented Agile methodology, assisted effective management of the development process, prioritisation of tasks, and consistent feedback and adjustment.

### **Testing phase :**

---

In an effort to guarantee compliance between the developed prototype and user requirements, several tests were performed. These tests aimed to validate the effectiveness, ease of use, and user satisfaction of the app's functionality. The testing process was customised according to the project's scope, considering the restrictions of limited resources and an individualised development methodology.

Following the completion of each sprint, a survey has been created to collect responses and recommendations from the users as part of usability testing. The [Survey](https://freeonlinesurveys.com/s/RuZX9S5H/i/0) included questions relevant to the usability, functionality, user satisfaction, and user interface. Implementation of the surveys into the testing process assists in the collection of quantitative data and insights from a student user base. Through engagement with the budget control application, users performed a series of instructions (see [ Appendix C ](#appendix-c)), which allowed the identification of potential challenges and measurement of their overall satisfaction . Usability metrics have been established to evaluate the effectiveness of a budget control application (see [ Appendix D ](#appendix-D)). The various metrics employed assisted in an in-depth examination of the functionality of the application by measuring different aspects.

Heatmaps (see [Appendix E ](#appendix-e)) assist in the discovery of parts of the app that receive the highest level of user attention within an application. Heatmaps provide information about user behaviour by monitoring their clicks and interactions, accordingly identifying the elements, features, or sections of an application that obtained the most attention.

After the collection of data from the usability survey and user observations, an analysis was performed. The collected data were used for analysis to identify common patterns and trends in the users feedback. The usability metrics provided numerical data regarding the application's efficiency and identified specific domains that required improvements. The iterative improvements of the application were driven by information obtained from testing and surveys, which ensured the accomplishment of user needs. The testing phase was essential in assessing the usability of the budget control application.

## **Conclusion and Results:**

---

The budget control application underwent a usability testing survey among 14 students, and it was found that all participants accomplished the set of instructions established in the earlier stage (see [Appendix F ](#appendix-f)). 95% of surveyed states that increasing a budget and adding transactions was relatively easy and the budget updates accordingly to income and spendings (see [Appendix G ](#appendix-g)). Almost all students responded that they received relevant feedback from the application. The survey question related to data entry issues received a weighted average score of 8.93 / 10 which proves most of the students did not experience any problems with entering the information into the budget app (see [Appendix H ](#appendix-h)). Only one student reported that he couldn't find all the relevant information, and two experienced performance issues like slow loading times. The application interface was assessed with an excellent score of 9.57, indicating a successfully designed and user-friendly interface. The majority of users expressed that the functionality of displaying transactions on graphs was beneficial and valuable.

Two survey questions focused on potential future enhancements and suggestions to improve the overall user experience of the application. A proposed solution for improving the user experience involved the creation of a tiered system for users, whereby they could accrue points upon achieving predetermined savings targets. According to other users, it would be advantageous to incorporate diverse currency systems to simplify the utilisation of the application for users from different countries (see [Appendix I ](#appendix-i)) .

In conclusion, the phases of prototyping and testing within the Design Thinking framework were essential in the development process of the budget control application. Prototype design and implementation of diverse testing methodologies ensured that the application satisfied the user requirements identified in the preceding phases. The utilisation of the Agile methodology, in conjunction with the Scrum framework, has facilitated a flexible and cooperative approach to successfully managing the development process, even in an individual development environment. The main objective was to provide an optimal application that satisfies user requirements and provides a smooth user interface. The application solves the problem identified  in the first stages of DT methodology, which states that  many students experience difficulties in managing their finances, including monitoring their expenditures, complying with a budget, and identifying opportunities to spend less money.
