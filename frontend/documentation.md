## **_Introduction_**

---

In the evolving landscape of education, students require tools that not only assist in academic learning but also promote social interaction and personal development.
This document outlines the design and development of the Student Hub application, a comprehensive single-page application crafted to enhance the educational and social experience of students. The application aims to facilitate better communication, collaboration, and learning among students, incorporating features such as posts, chat, quizzes, and games. Building upon the principles of the Design Thinking approach, the application is tailored to meet the diverse needs of students, fostering an interactive and engaging learning environment.
The Student Hub application is designed to address these needs by offering a unified platform for communication, learning, and entertainment. This report focuses on the latter stages of the Design Thinking methodology, particularly the Prototype and Test phases.

<br><br>

## **_Methodology:_**

---

The Agile methodology based on Design Thinking, along with the Scrum framework, was applied in the development process of the Student Hub application.
Agile Scrum focuses on breaking down the project into small, manageable iterations (sprints). This approach is ideal for developing a multifaceted app like Student Hub, as it allows me to focus on one set of features (like posts,chats,games and quizzes) at a time, ensuring quality and functionality before moving on to the next set.
In an environment where user needs and technology trends are constantly evolving, Agile Scrum allows for greater flexibility. As new insights are gained from interviews and surveys, a developer can easily adapt and revise the approach to better meet user requirements.

  <i>Scrum Process Visualization</i>
</p> <br>
Agile Scrum encourages regular feedback from users. By conducting contextual interviews and surveys, the developer can gather valuable user insights and quickly incorporate this feedback into the app development, ensuring the final product is well-tuned to the needs and preferences of its target audience.

By dividing the project into sprints, risks are identified and addressed early in the development process. This proactive approach to risk management is particularly beneficial for a complex app with various features, as it allows for timely adjustments without changing the entire project.

Regular testing and reviews at the end of each sprint ensure that each feature of the app is thoroughly tested and meets quality standards. This is crucial for an educational app, where reliability and user experience are paramount.

Agile Scrum's focus on user involvement and iterative delivery means that the app is developed with a deep understanding of user needs. This results in a product that resonates more with students and educators, ultimately leading to higher user satisfaction. With Agile Scrum, a basic version of the app with essential features can be launched quickly. This is beneficial for gauging user response and making necessary adjustments in subsequent sprints.

  <i>Software Development Life Cycle Phases</i>
</p><br>
 
 
The first phase involve creating User Stories( [Appendix A](#appendix-a) ), concise descriptions of key features and functionalities as seen through the eyes of the end-user. These stories, representing the perspective of the end user, have been organized and ranked in a backlog based on their significance and overall value. Then the project broken down into sprints, each lasting for some weeks based on the user stories. In each iteration it is tried to implement distinict features of the application based on the user specific needs and preferences.

In conclusion, using Agile Scrum for the development of the Student Hub app ensures that the project is adaptable, user-centric, and quality-focused. By leveraging insights from contextual interviews and surveys, the development process becomes more aligned with user needs, thereby increasing the likelihood of the app's success in the educational technology market.

## **Methods:**

---

In order to ensure a precise and structured approach to the development of the Student Hub application, it is tried to focus on integrating the final two phases of the Design Thinking framework, emphasizing prototyping and testing. Moreover, the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) model will be seen in delve, detailing its application throughout the development stage of the software.

### **Prototype phase :**

---

In the prototyping phase of the Student Hub application, which encompasses features like post, chat, quiz, and game, I tailored the Design Thinking approach, commonly used in team settings, to suit the unique needs of an individual project. This phase involved crafting a tangible prototype that represent the app's key functionalities and user interface. I employed Figma as a tool to create detailed visual representations of the proposed features, along with interactive mockups that provided a clear picture of the appâ€™s design and operational flow.

<br><br>

Adhering to the principles of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) model, I adopted the Agile methodology within the Scrum framework, despite working as an independent developer. This approach allowed me to assume multiple roles, including that of a product owner and user, which was instrumental in ensuring that the prototype was in line with the user requirements identified during the early stages of the Design Thinking process. Agile practices, known for promoting iterative development, teamwork, and adaptability, proved to be highly effective for this small-scale, individual project. The implementation of the Scrum framework, a widely recognized Agile methodology, facilitated efficient management of the development process. It helped in prioritizing tasks effectively and allowed for continuous feedback and necessary adjustments, ensuring that the prototype of the Student Hub app met its intended goals and user expectations.

### **Testing phase :**

---

For the testing phase of the Student Hub application, which incorporates features such as posts, chat, quizzes, and games, a series of [Survey](https://freeonlinesurveys.com/s/7cB3Enxa) questions were crafted to assess the application's performance (see [ Appendix B ](#appendix-b)).
. These questions were specifically designed to evaluate the app using standard usability metrics, including user satisfaction, clarity of terminology, layout and design, navigation, and other crucial aspects impacting the user experience.

This approach aimed to gather actionable insights from potential users, helping to fine-tune the app for optimal functionality and user engagement. The survey delved into various aspects of the application, asking users to rate and provide feedback on the ease of use, aesthetic appearance of the design, and the effectiveness of navigation within the app. Additionally, it sought users' opinions on the relevance and clarity of the terminology used, ensuring that the app's language resonated well with its target audience.

The feedback collected through this survey was instrumental in identifying areas of improvement and success, ultimately guiding further refinements to enhance the overall user experience of the Student Hub application. By focusing on these key usability metrics, the testing phase was strategically aligned to ensure that the app not only met its functional objectives but also delivered a satisfying and intuitive experience to its users (see [ Appendix C ](#appendix-c)).

## **Conclusion and Results:**

---

A usability test was carried out on the Student Hub app, with 19 Solent University students taking part voluntarily. Every participant managed to log in and create a new post without trouble (see [ Appendix D ](#appendix-d)). On average, they rated the app's design and layout 8.47 out of 10 for visually appealing. They also gave 8.26 out of 10 for how easy it was to message another student (see [ Appendix E ](#appendix-e)). Additionally, they found taking quizzes easy, scoring it 8.63 out of 10, and everyone could see their quiz results successfully (see [ Appendix F ](#appendix-f)).

Participants also enjoyed the game feature and found it simple to play. They were happy with the feedback it provided. Most respondents were pleased with the app overall "Feedback", giving it a high score of 8.16 out of 10 (see [ Appendix G ](#appendix-g)). Only four people had issues with "Navigation" around the app, and most found it easy to enter data("Data Entry"), scoring this 8.11 out of 10 (see [ Appendix H ](#appendix-h)). The app received an 8.26 out of 10 overall satisfaction rating, with many suggesting adding voice and video calls and more advanced games (see [ Appendix I ](#appendix-i)). These survey results show that the Student Hub app really meets what its users need and prefer, offering great user experience features.

In conclusion, using prototyping and testing as part of the Design Thinking process was key in creating the Student Hub app. This detailed approach made sure the app was fun and interactive, with features like posts, chat, quizzes, and games, meeting what users needed from the start. Using Agile methods and the Scrum framework helped manage the development process well, even for an individual project.

The main goal in making the Student Hub app was to solve problems students face, which was identified earlier in the Design Thinking process. These included needing a single place for effective communication, learning, lesiure activities, and supporting their study journey. Through various tests and making changes to the prototype, the app became user-friendly with a execellent interface.

Overall, the app fills the gap in students' everyday study and social life. It's a strong tool for managing study work while also being part of the community and enjoying leisure time.
